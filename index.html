      How I Met Your Mother (often abbreviated as HIMYM) is an American sitcom,
      created by Craig Thomas and Carter Bays for CBS. The series, which aired
      from September 19, 2005 to March 31, 2014, follows the main character, Ted
      Mosby, and his group of friends in New York City's Manhattan. As a framing
      device, Ted, in 2030, recounts to his son, Luke, and daughter, Penny, the
      events from September 2005 to May 2013 that led him to meet their mother.
      How I Met Your Mother is a joint production by Bays & Thomas Productions
      and 20th Century Fox Television and syndicated by 20th Television (now
      Disney-ABC Domestic Television).
